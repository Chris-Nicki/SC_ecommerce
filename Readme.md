# **Star Citizen E Commerce API**

## **Welcome to the Star Citizen E Commerce API**

This application will act as the API for all things Star Citizen.

## **How it Works:**

In this application you will be able to Add, View, Update, and Delete;
- Customers
- Customer Account
- Products
- Orders
- Reviews

### Getting Started: ###

The user will select the appropriate action from the side bar in their postman application.
**Welcome to the Star Citizen E Commerce Database**


I would like to:

    ex. Add Customer


**Adding a customer**
- When you select POST Customer, you will need to fill out the appropriate fields as shown below in the example. 
- {
    "name": "Ryan McBoyle",
    "birthday" : "1986-04-25",
    "email": "BOYLY@gmail.com",
    "phone": "1251459554"
    
  }


- Follow any other prompts to complete the requested actions

- Any errors will be met with an error message letting the user know the issue.
- Once the appropriate action has been completed the application will display a message to confirm.

    *ex. "message": "New customer added successfully!"*

- All other sections function identical to the above, fill out the appropriate fields and you will get the appropriate message.

    

### Features: ###
- User can post reviews on a product through the Product ID. The user may choose to remain anonymous if they should choose.


- Built in error system that will prompt the user to correct the action, with an error explanation. 

    *ex. Status: 500 Internal Server Error*
